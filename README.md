# Developerro.AzureFunctions.CustomBindings

This repository contains samples about how you can create your custom azure functions bindings and triggers. It is related with some articles from my blog (in spanish):

- [Custom out bindings](https://www.developerro.com/2019/04/15/azure-functions-custom-out-bindings/)
- [Custom in bindings](https://www.developerro.com/2019/04/23/azure-functions-custom-in-bindings/)
- [Custom triggers](https://www.developerro.com/2019/05/02/azure-functions-custom-triggers/)

Actually, these customs binding are not ready for production environments...
